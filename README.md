# song_recommender_system 


The purpose of this academic small project is mainly to practice web scraping and working with API´s.

Here we can find two folders, one called scripts, and another one called data, as well as the song_recommender_system itself. 

Within the scripts folder we can find:

  - billboard_data_web_scraping file. Python script in which web scraping has been performed to collect the Billboard Hot 100 list of songs and artist of the moment. 
  - spotify_data_collection_and_clustering file. Python script in which the code can be seen to connect to Spotify´s API in order obatin a collection of songs, artists, and the audio features of the songs   

Within the data folder we can find:

  - billboard_data file.
  - spotify_data file.
